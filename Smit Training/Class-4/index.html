<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br> <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br /> <b>It has survived not only five centuries,</b> but also the leap into electronictypesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <hr /> <i>And more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</i></p>
